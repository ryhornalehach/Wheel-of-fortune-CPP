the dock of the bay
in my life
stairway to heaven
a day in the life
gimme shelter
that'll be the day
sympathy for the devil
light my fire
you've lost that loving feeling
dancing in the streets
no woman no cry
river deep, mountain high
tutti frutti
georgia on my mind
the message
all along the watchtower
the tracks of my tears
waterloo sunset
hotel california
heartbreak hotel
bridge over troubled water

jailhouse rock
sunshine of your love
tangled up in blue
summertime blues
whole lotta love
mystery train
mr tambourine man
blueberry hill
papa's got a brand new bag
superstition
strawberry fields forever
i feel good
i heard it through the grapevine
thunder road
every breath you take
my girl
in the still of the night
you really got me
california dreamin
suspicious minds
ring of fire
i still haven't found what i'm looking for
roll over beethoven
blue suede shoes

great balls of fire
fortunate son
